# Wtf is that

NIU.MOE has been a cozy place on the fediverse from April 2017 up to the last day of 2020.

I wanted to put something instead of a blank page, in memory of the community, so there it is !

It have been made with https://animejs.com/v3 and a bunch of dirty hardcoded hacks. Could be way better but ðŸ˜´.
